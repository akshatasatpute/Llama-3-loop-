# Llama-3-loop

I conducted extensive research in an attempt to gain access to the latest Llama-3 model on unsloth, Hugging face, Meta but unfortunately, I encountered difficulties in accessing it from the available sites. Consequently, I focused on
formulating the logic required to create an infinite loop utilizing this model. Since pre-trained models are readily accessible on the web and can be fine-tuned according to specific datasets, my efforts were
directed towards developing a loop that could facilitate continuous interaction with the Llama-3 model.

This code contains a Flask web application that utilizes the Transformers library from Hugging Face to create a chatbot using the Meta-Llama language model. The app
allows users to interact with the chatbot by sending prompts and receiving responses. Additionally, the code includes functions to generate responses and manage the
chatbot interaction using the Meta-Llama language model. This project could be shared as a Flask web application with a conversational interface powered by the Meta
Llama language model.

The provided code utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to implement a chatbot powered by the Meta-Llama language model within a Flask web application. The
model is specified using the name 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B', and is instantiated along with its tokenizer. A function called generate_response is defined to
generate chatbot responses based on user prompts. The code invokes the generate_response function within a conditional block to start the chatbot interaction. This
setup enables users to interact with the Meta-Llama language model-based chatbot via the web application, creating a conversational interface for users to engage
with the language model.

The code for this is provided in the Llama-3.py file.

The websites I explored to get the free access to the Llama-3 is mentioned below:
